Sky Team Routes of the Week

We are back to the ATC choice this week and it once again, means we play a bit of a guessing game on open ATC locations! However, we'll play it smart to give you some great flights this week into the featured locations, as well as areas we have our fingers crossed on being open!
Pilots can fly each route ONE time and any rank may fly it regardless of rank! Flights must be logged by midnight PDT for a 1.5x bonus!
Please select DL ROTW for route number when filing your route
