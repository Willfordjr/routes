*`Sky Team Routes of the Week`*
We head to the beach this week with KMIA as our featured host on the IFATC schedule! With an array of openings around the Sky Team network, it's setting up to be a great week of routes to fly in the SkyTeam Network!

Pilots can fly each route ONE time and any rank may fly it regardless of rank! Flights must be logged by midnight PDT for a 1.5x bonus!

*_Please log your flight with the flight number of DL ROTW. Mark yes for medallions ONLY if you have not flown the route before if itâ€™s a DLVA route. Routes logged incorrectly will be marked as invalid._*
