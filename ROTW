*`Sky Team Routes of the Week`*
It's a European week this week as we feature a variety of Air France, KLM, Alitalia and Aeroflot routes along with a few others sprinkled in! We hope you have a great week flying with the Sky Team Liveries, and that the American contingent of Sky Team has a great fourth of July! Stay safe all!

*Pilots can fly each route ONE time and any rank may fly it regardless of rank! Flights must be logged by midnight PDT for a 1.5x bonus!*

*_Please log your flight with the flight number of DL ROTW. Mark yes for medallions ONLY if you have not flown the route before if itâ€™s a DLVA route. Routes logged incorrectly will be marked as invalid._*
